/**
 * This package contains all date related classes and information.
 * <p>
 * <strong>VERY IMPORTANT:</strong> SQLite date functions:
 * <a href="https://sqlite.org/lang_datefunc.html">https://sqlite.org/lang_datefunc.html</a>
 * <p>
 * <pre>
 *      Function        Equivalent strftime()
 *      date(...)       strftime('%Y-%m-%d', ...)
 *      time(...)       strftime('%H:%M:%S', ...)
 *      datetime(...)   strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S', ...)
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * ==> the default 'datetime' function <strong>does NOT include the 'T' character</strong>
 * as used in ISO standards.
 * <p>
 * ==> the standard 'current_timestamp' <strong>does NOT include the 'T' character</strong>
 * * as used in ISO standards.
 * <p>
 * Which means that when using {@link java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter}
 * versus SQLite 'datetime/current_timestamp' conversions between 'T' and ' ' will need to be done.
 * Reading/writing itself is not an issue (parsers in sqlite and in our app take care of that),
 * but <strong>string COMPARE as in 'where' clauses</strong> will cause faulty results.
 * <p>
 * Affected columns are those of type
 * {@link  com.hardbacknutter.nevertoomanybooks.database.definitions.SqLiteDataType#DateTime}.
 * Status on 2020-09-26:
 * {@link com.hardbacknutter.nevertoomanybooks.database.DBKey#DATE_ADDED__UTC}
 * {@link com.hardbacknutter.nevertoomanybooks.database.DBKey#DATE_LAST_UPDATED__UTC}
 * and
 * {@link com.hardbacknutter.nevertoomanybooks.database.CoversDbHelper}#CKEY_UTC_DATETIME
 * <p>
 * Columns of type
 * {@link  com.hardbacknutter.nevertoomanybooks.database.definitions.SqLiteDataType#Date}
