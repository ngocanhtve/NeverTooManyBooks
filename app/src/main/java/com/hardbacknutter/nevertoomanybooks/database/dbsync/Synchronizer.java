/**
 * Implementation of a Readers/Writer lock that is fully reentrant.
 * <p>
 * Because SQLite throws exception on locking conflicts, this class can be used to serialize
 * WRITE access while allowing concurrent read access.
 * <p>
 * Each logical database should have its own {@link Synchronizer}
 * Before any read, or group of reads, a call to getSharedLock() should be made.
 * A call to getExclusiveLock() should be made before any update.
 * Multiple calls can be made as necessary so long as an unlock() is called for all get*()
 * calls by using the SyncLock object returned from the get*() call.
 * <p>
 * These can be called in any order and locks in the current thread never block requests.
 * <p>
 * Deadlocks are not possible because the implementation involves a single lock object.
 * <p>
 * <strong>Note:</strong> This lock can cause writer starvation since it does not introduce
 * pending locks.
