This is a book catalogue application, to keep track of your books and comics.
Books can be added either manually, by ISBN, or by barcode.

Data is fetched from multiple internet sites.

Requires minimal Android 8.0 (API 26)

To install the optional Calibre code which provides Virtual Library support,
see [Calibre AJAX extension](https://github.com/tfonteyn/NeverTooManyBooks/blob/dev/app/src/main/java/com/hardbacknutter/nevertoomanybooks/sync/calibre/ajax_additions.py)

In August 2018, this project was forked from:
Book Catalogue 5.2.2 @2016 Philip Warner & Evan Leybourn.
Without their original creation, this project would not exist in its
current form. It was however largely rewritten/refactored and any
comments on this fork should be directed at myself and not
at the original creators.
