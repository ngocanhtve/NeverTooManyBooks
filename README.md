This is a book collection application, to keep track of your books and comics.

Make sure to check the [documentation](https://github.com/tfonteyn/NeverTooManyBooks/wiki)

The UI is available in:

- English, Dutch, Portuguese.
- German, French: quality should be very good but may lack in some places.
- Italian, Spanish: should be usable, but certainly not perfect.
- Czech, Greek, Polish, Russian, Turkish: mostly machine translated, no guarantees for quality.

Translations are now integrated and editable
on [https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/nevertoomanybooks/](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/nevertoomanybooks/)

In August 2018, this project was forked from:
Book Catalogue 5.2.2 @2016 Philip Warner & Evan Leybourn.
Without their original creation, this project would not exist in its
current form. It was however largely rewritten/refactored and any
comments on this fork should be directed at myself and not
at the original creators.
