In August 2018, this project was forked from:
Book Catalogue 5.2.2 @2016 Philip Warner & Evan Leybourn.
Without their original creation, this project would not exist in its
current form. It was however largely rewritten/refactored and any
comments on this fork should be directed at myself and not
at the original creators.
