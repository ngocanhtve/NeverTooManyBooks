       Used to store metadata in the Checkstyle configuration file. This
       information is ignored by Checkstyle. This may be useful if you want to
       store plug-in specific information.

       To avoid name clashes between different tools/plug-ins you are *strongly*
       encouraged to prefix all names with your domain name. For example, use the
       name "com.mycompany.parameter" instead of "parameter".

       The prefix "com.puppycrawl." is reserved for Checkstyle.

       Can be used to replaced some generic Checkstyle messages with a custom
       messages.

       The 'key' attribute specifies for which actual Checkstyle message the
       replacing should occur, look into Checkstyle's message.properties for
       the according message keys.

       The 'value' attribute defines the custom message patterns including
       message parameter placeholders as defined in the original Checkstyle
       messages (again see message.properties for reference).
