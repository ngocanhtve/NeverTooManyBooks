5.3.0

NEW:

- Improved grid-layout: the cover size as set in the style preference which was previously
  limited to list-mode only, is now also applied to the grid-layout. An XL size was added
  which in portrait view will display 1 cover/book the full-width of the screen, and in
  landscape view 2 covers/books. The 'large' and other sizes will use a number of covers
  as suited to the size of your screen. (refer to github issue #32)
- Further customizing of grid-layout with style-preferences: Bringing up the
  book-context-menu can now be configured to use a long-click on the cover
  instead of the 3dot button.

FIXES:

- books without a cover are now displayed properly in list-mode.
